# Jenkins Image Gallery Plug-in

This plug-in reads a job workspace and collects images to produce an image 
gallery using [colorbox](http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox "Colorbox") 
lightbox Javascript library.

This plug-in was created to mimic the behaviour of 
[Bioportal](http://www.bioportal.uio.no/ "OSLO BioPortal") jobs that display 
images in [BioUno](http://www.biouno.org "BioUno"), a project that uses Jenkins 
for running BioInformatics tools and managing clusters.

For more about this plug-in check its 
[Wiki](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Image+Gallery+Plugin "Jenkins Image Gallery Plug-in Wiki").
